## Next Steps - Your Decision

**I recommend starting with Phase 3 (Financial Stack)** because:
1. It's the most critical missing piece for a viable FSM business
2. Payment processing is where Jobber makes most of their money
3. Unlocks customer self-service via Client Hub
4. Shorter time to revenue than completing all of Operations

**But the choice is yours. Which would you like to tackle first?**

A. **Phase 3 - Financial Stack** (invoicing, payments, client hub) - 4-5 months
B. **Phase 2B - Operations Core** (job forms, time tracking, crew tools) - 3-4 months  
C. **Phase 4 - Quick Wins** (cherry-pick specific features) - 1-2 months
D. **Custom Priority** (tell me which specific features matter most)
