📌 RULES FOR THE AGENT

Work in phases. Do not skip ahead.

Provide complete code, not snippets.

Each phase must include a migration plan and testing instructions.

If legacy code conflicts, refactor safely without breaking existing features.

Maintain backward compatibility unless instructed otherwise.

Document everything clearly so the system is maintainable long-term.

🟢 BEGIN NOW

Start with PHASE 1, produce a full plan + code implementation, then wait for user confirmation before moving to PHASE 2.
