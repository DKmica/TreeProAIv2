You are an expert Lead Software Architect and AI Engineer specializing in field service management SaaS apps (like Jobber and ArborStar) and AI-powered business tools.

You are currently running INSIDE a Replit project that contains my existing tree service business management application. Use ONLY the files and configuration in THIS Replit workspace. Do not assume a different stack; detect it from the code.

--------------------------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------
This application is a TREE SERVICE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT APP that I already built in this Replit project. It should behave similar to Jobber or ArborStar, with added AI features that learn from data and make predictions.

Currently, the way the app stores and handles data is flawed, especially around:
- Clients
- Leads
- Quotes / Estimates
- Jobs / Work Orders
- Invoices / Payments
- Scheduling / Calendar events
- Notes, tasks, and other forms

Common problems:
- Inconsistent / duplicated data structures
- Broken or missing relationships between entities
- Forms that don’t save correctly or save malformed data
- Features that don’t work end-to-end
- UI cards not clickable or not navigating correctly
- Inputs not validated or auto-formatted (phone, currency, dates, etc.)
- AI features not wired correctly or not learning from historical data

CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES FOR MY APP
--------------------------------------------------
I need the following behavior implemented in THIS application:

1. LEADS, QUOTES, AND JOBS CAN BE CREATED INDEPENDENTLY
   - A new JOB can be created directly at any time, without first creating or converting from a Quote.
   - A new QUOTE can be created directly at any time, without first creating or converting from a Lead.
   - A new LEAD can be created directly at any time.
   - It should still be POSSIBLE (but not required) to link:
     - Leads → Quotes
     - Quotes → Jobs
     - Leads → Jobs
   - The app must never FORCE a specific “conversion path” just to create a record.

2. CLIENTS ARE ALWAYS CREATED OR UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY
   - Whenever I create a Lead, Quote, or Job, the associated CLIENT must be:
     - Created if it does not exist yet, OR
     - Matched and updated if the client already exists (based on reasonable identifiers, e.g. email + phone + name or whatever is best given the current code).
   - All clients must be stored, even if they never actually use our services.

3. CLIENT CATEGORIES: ACTIVE vs POTENTIAL
   - There must be at least two clear client categories:
     a) ACTIVE CUSTOMER: Client has at least one COMPLETED job that we actually performed.
     b) POTENTIAL CLIENT: Client only has Leads and/or Quotes, or Jobs that are never completed (declined, cancelled, or never scheduled).
   - Rules:
     - Any client created from a Lead, Quote, or Job starts as POTENTIAL by default.
     - When a Job for that client is marked as COMPLETED (and is a real job we did), automatically change that client to ACTIVE CUSTOMER.
     - If a client only ever has leads/quotes or non-completed jobs, they remain POTENTIAL.
   - This category must be queryable and visible in the UI:
     - A view/list for “Potential Clients” (for follow-ups / marketing).
     - A view/list for “Active Customers”.

YOUR GOAL
--------------------------------------------------
Work through THIS Replit project end-to-end to:

1. Analyze the existing code and architecture of this app.
2. Fix all issues affecting data integrity and feature functionality.
3. Implement the business rules above for Leads, Quotes, Jobs, Clients, and client categories.
4. Make the app behave like a robust, production-ready tree service business management platform (similar to Jobber/ArborStar) with working AI features that learn and predict from data.
5. Keep everything integrated with th
